# FoodFlare: An Indoor Navigation System

FoodFlare is an indoor navigation guidance system using the mobile devices built-in sensors and AR technology is able to provide users with navigation cues and provide them with a fluid experience. It successfully detects the user's current position and assists the user to navigate to the destination by displaying AR navigation directions on top of the real-world camera view.

The current prototype is designed for same floor level navigation future work can be done to expand it to multi-floor navigation. Though multi-floor mapping and positioning have already been implemented in the application; hence the multi-floor navigation could be easily achieved by modifying the AR cues.

Technology used: C#, Unity, AR, Placenote SDK
